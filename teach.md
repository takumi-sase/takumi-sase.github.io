### Discrete Mathematics
*Discrete Maths* is a part of mathematics devoted to the study of mathematical structures of discrete objects, which I handled in the course **Mathematics for Computing I** in KICT, IIUM (Sem 1 & 2 2020/2021, Sem 1 & 2 2021/2022). [Ref 1, 2](#references)

| Data dimension | Discrete structure | Represents: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | number, proposition | discrete objects |
| 1 | set, sequence, string | a collection of discrete objects (set, list) |
| 2 | matrix, relation, function, tree, graph | a relationship between discrete objects |

### Structured Programming
*Structured Programming* is the core part of programming, where a problem can be solved by the combination of functions. I taught this programming approach *using C++* in the course **Elements of Programming** in KICT, IIUM (Sem 1 & 2 2020/2021, Sem 1 & 2 2021/2022). [Ref 3, 4](#references)

| Data type | Category | Stores: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simple | integral, floating point | scalar data |
| Structured | array | a list of a fixed number of items of the *same* data type |
|| structure | a list of a fixed number of items whose data types may be *different* |
|| class | a structure with functions
| Pointer | pointer to each data type | memory addresses |
