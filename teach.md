## Teaching

### Teaching Interests
- Mathematics&mdash;[Discrete Mathematics](#discrete-mathematics), Cryptography, Dynamical Systems
- Programming&mdash;[Structured Programming](#structured-programming), Object-Oriented Programming

### Teaching Experience
#### 2022/2023
Mathematics for Computing I, Elements of Programming, Final Year Project II, Final Year Project I, Cryptography
#### 2021/2022
Mathematics for Computing I, Elements of Programming, Final Year Project I
#### 2020/2021
Mathematics for Computing I, Elements of Programming

### Discrete Mathematics
*Discrete Maths* is a part of mathematics devoted to the study of mathematical structures of discrete objects, which I handled in the course **Mathematics for Computing I** in KICT, IIUM (2020/2021, 2021/2022, 2022/2023). [Ref 1, 2](#references)

| Data dimension | Discrete structure | Represents: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | number, character, proposition | discrete objects |
| 1 | set | a collection of discrete objects |
|| sequence, string | a list of discrete objects |
| 2 | matrix, relation, function, tree, graph | a relationship between discrete objects |

### Structured Programming
*Structured Programming* is the core part of programming, where a problem can be solved by the combination of functions. I taught this programming approach *using C++ and Java* in the course **Elements of Programming** in KICT, IIUM (2020/2021, 2021/2022, 2022/2023). [Ref 3, 4](#references)

| Data type | Category | Stores: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simple | integral, floating point | scalar data |
| Structured | array | a list of a fixed number of items of the *same* data type |
|| structure | a list of a fixed number of items whose data types may be *different* |
|| class | a structure with functions
| Pointer | pointer to each data type | memory addresses |

### Supervision
#### Final Year Project
Under my supervision, students are allowed to work on any topic (Research, Development) if it is related to *Data Science*.
