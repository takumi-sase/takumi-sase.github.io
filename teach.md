### Mathematics for Computing I
In this course, students had oppotunities to learn about *Discrete Mathematics* (Sem 1 & 2 2020/2021, Sem 1 & 2 2021/2022).

| Data dimension | Discrete structures | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | number, proposition | discrete objects |
| 1 | set, sequence, string | a collection of discrete objects (set, list) |
| 2 | matrix, tree, graph | a relation between sets/on a set |

### Elements of Programming
This course was designed to introduce students to *Structured Programming using C++* (Sem 1 & 2 2020/2021, Sem 1 & 2 2021/2022).

| Data type | Categories | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simple | integral, floating point | scalar data |
| Structured | array, structure | a list of a fixed number of items |
| Pointer | | memory addresses |
