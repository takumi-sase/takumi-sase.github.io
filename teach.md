### Mathematics for Computing I
In this course, students had oppotunities to learn about *Discrete Mathematics* (Sem 1 & 2 2020/2021, Sem 1 & 2 2021/2022).

| Data dimension | Discrete structure | Topics in MFC1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | number, proposition | |
| 1 | set, sequence, string | |
| 2 | matrix, tree, graph | |

### Elements of Programming
This course was designed to introduce students to *Structured Programming using C++* (Sem 1 & 2 2020/2021, Sem 1 & 2 2021/2022).
