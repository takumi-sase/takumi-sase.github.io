## Why nonlinear?
### Linear dynamical system
It's better to know what the linear dynamical system is first. A linear dynamical system is defined as

$$ \frac{{\rm{d}}x}{{\rm{d}}t}=Ax(t), $$

where $x(t)$ is a state of this system at time $t$, and $A$ represents the relation between $x(t)$ and $x(t+{\delta}t)$. Suppose the state $x(t)$ is characterised by $d$ numeric variables, i.e., $x(t)\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Denoting $x(t)$ as a column vector, $A$ can be a square matrix of size $d$.
