## Why nonlinear?
### Linear dynamical system
It's better to know what the linear dynamical system is before going to the nonlinear. In general, a linear dynamical system is defined as

$$ \frac{{\rm{d}}x}{{\rm{d}}t}=Ax(t), $$

where $x(t)$ is a state of this system at time $t$, and $A$ determines the relation between $x(t)$ and $x(t+{\delta}t)$. the current state and the of a system we're interested in, in a $d$-dimensional state space, i.e., $x(t)\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$ at time $t$
