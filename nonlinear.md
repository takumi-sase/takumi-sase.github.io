## Why nonlinear?
### Linear dynamical system
It's better to know what the linear dynamical system is before going to the nonlinear. In general, a linear dynamical system is defined as

$$ \frac{{\rm{d}}x}{{\rm{d}}t}=Ax(t), $$

where $x(t)$ is a state in a $n$-dimensional state space, i.e., $x(t)\in R$ at time $t$
