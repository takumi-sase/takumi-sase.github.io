## Research
### Research Interests
My interest is to unravel mathematics of brain's electric computing, at a macroscopic level. It means, to describe the brain system (neurons, synapses, networks) by mathematical equations, so that we can simulate brain's activity (EEG) on a computer.

### Research Topics
- Mathematical Modelling of Human Brain Electrodynamics
- Development of the EEG Simulator

### Disciplines
Computational Neuroscience, Applied Mathematics

### Expertise
dynamical systems, mathematical modelling, time series analysis, signal processing, EEG

### Programming Languages
C, C++, MATLAB, Python
