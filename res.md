## Research
### Research Interests
My interest is to unravel nonlinear dynamics of brain computing, at the micro-macro scale. It means, to describe the brain (neurons, synapses, networks) by a nonlinear dynamical system, so that we can simulate brain's activity (EEG etc.) on a computer.

### Research Topics
- Mathematical Modelling of Nonlinear Human Brain Electrodynamics
  - T. Sase & K. Kitajo (2021). **The metastable brain associated with autistic-like traits of typically developing individuals**. *PLOS Comput. Biol.* 17(4): e1008929. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008929)
- Development of the EEG Simulator

### Disciplines
Computational Neuroscience, Applied Mathematics

### Expertise
