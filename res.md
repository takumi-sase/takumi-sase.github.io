## Research
### Research Interests
My interest is to unravel nonlinear dynamics of brain computing, at a macroscopic level. It means, to describe the brain (neurons, synapses, networks) by a nonlinear dynamical system, so that we can simulate brain's activity (EEG etc.) on a computer.

### Research Topics
- Mathematical Modelling of Nonlinear Human Brain Electrodynamics
- Development of the EEG Simulator

### Disciplines
Computational Neuroscience, Applied Mathematics

### Expertise
dynamical systems, time series analysis, bifurcation analysis, signal processing, EEG

### Programming Languages
C, C++, MATLAB, Python
