## Research
### Research Interests
My strong interest is to find the first principle of brain computing. This means, to describe the brain system (neurons, synapses, networks) using mathematical equations, so that we can simulate brainâ€™s electric dynamics & activity by solving those equations on a computer.

### Research Projects
- **Mathematical Modelling of Human Brain Electrodynamics**

### Disciplines
Computational Neuroscience, Applied Mathematics

### Expertise
Dynamical Systems, Mathematical Modelling, Bifurcation Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Signal Processing, EEG

### Programming Languages
C, C++, MATLAB, Python
