## my interest history
### 2006&ndash;2007
The thing which made me so curious is the *Fourier transoform*, which transforms a signal (on the time axis) to a spectrum (on the frequency axis).
The signals were recorded from different music scales, and I remember that those waveforms were very complex, but after the Fourier transform, spectrum was very clear.
